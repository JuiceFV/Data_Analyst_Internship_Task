Rambler Group's advertising campaign uses most fascinating and most memorable banners.
Analytics have access to the databases containing data regard the banner' showing.
The \textbf{Shows\_table} contains:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{show\_id} - an identifier of a showing 
	\item \emph{day} - a day of a showig
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[h]
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}

	28736    & 2019-02-22 \\ \hline

\section*{Problem 2}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{\protect\numberline{}Problem 2}%

The friendly Rambler Group's community likes to play in the table football: 
At the odd days they play before lunch, at the even days the play after lunch.
They are splitting at the N teams among each other, and every team plays with each another team.
Because of the splitting onto the teams is randomly, the product of the games is random.
Also I would note that there are no ties. Only win or lose.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Estimate the probability if one of the teams will finish the tournament without defeat.
	\item How many times do you need to hold a tournament, so that with a probability of 98\% at least once this happened?
\end{enumerate}
